	Annote = {They take physiological data (skin conductance and electromyography) of a user in real-time, interpret them as emotions, and address the user{\^a}€{\texttrademark}s affective states by empathic feedback. A decision making agent relates these signals and the user{\^a}€{\texttrademark}s answer to arousal and valence to infer the user{\^a}€{\texttrademark}s emotional state by applying the model of Lang (1995) (Lang claims that all emotions can be characterized in terms of valence (pleasant or unpleasant) and arousal (calm or aroused)). Then it selects empathetic actions that maximize some utility function. They use text-based empathetic actions in addition to a small full body character.We can use the decision-theoretic agent aspect in our empathy model.
The empathy is mainly expressed in a text-base fashion in their job. The embodied agent that they have is so small and no facial expressions are used. There are some gestural expressions.
As shown in this paper and many other ones, text-base empathy expression can be effective. So we can use that too.

2-{\^A} {\^A} {\^A} {\^A} {\^A}  Modality of delivering such content. 
        
They define empathy as the ability to detect what others feel and to experience that emotion ourselves (seems like mimicry).
        
Empirical evidence indicates that expressing accurate empathy can lead to positive psychological, physical and health outcomes.
        
Their results show: 
1. The positive attitude of the users toward active support (active empathy). 
2.{\^A}  The positive outcome of an empathic system regardless of its representation. 
3.{\^A}  A system represented by a human-like representation is expected to be empathic.
        
they believe, adding a mechanism to allow the users to freely express themselves does not improve the effectiveness or liking of an empathic system.

@article{Baldassarri2008,
	Annote = {Summery: 
        
Their system is an animating engine which allows management of scenes and virtual characters. It provides multimodal emotional interaction with the user. The virtual characters have different emotional facial expressions, lip-synch, and emotional voice. The expressions are selected based on the character's emotional state and the relationship with the user during conversation.
        
In this research they focus on the interactive virtual agents that support multimodal and emotional interaction in order to establish more effective communication with the user. So, the character captures the user{\^a}€{\texttrademark}s emotional facial expressions through a camera, and responds with appropriate emotional facial expressions and voices.
        
They use Ekman{\^a}€{\texttrademark}s emotional facial classification for recognition and expression: happiness, sadness, anger, fear, surprise, disgust, and neutral.
        
Positive points:
        
 - Good references for us: 
        
"most research on social interfaces is related to the design of embodied conversational agents (ECAs) [1]".
        
"Virtual characters equipped with these new features can be used in a wide range of contexts [2,3], including education and learning [4{\^a}€``8], sign language interpretation [9], therapy [10], persuasion [11,12],entertainment [13,14], among others".
        
"In order to achieve a more natural and realistic interaction,
virtual agents must be capable of appropriately responding to users with affective feedback [15]".
        
 - another application that we can add to the future grants:
we can use our system to interact with with disabled clients (for example, the hearing-impaired or paraplegics) if we add appropriate voice recognition, NLP, and body languages to the system.
        
 - they use a voice recognition engine built on the commercial Loquendo ASR software [22] which we can use too. 
        
- They use the same model as our system for the character's feedbacks. There are 2 kinds of character feedbacks in their system: 1- Purely reactive: For example, if the user keys something in, the virtual character will interrupt the presentation; or if the user changes his or her position, the character{\^a}€{\texttrademark}s look/ orientation will change; if a lot of background noise is detected, it will request silence, etc. 
        
2- Deliberative: The choice of the virtual character{\^a}€{\texttrademark}s reaction needs more complex analysis.
 - They use emotional voice as another modality by modifying the tone, frequency scale, volume and speed. We can do the same to add the another modality to the emotion expression of our system. 
        
        
Negative points:
        
 - It is not clear what avatar system they use. It looks like Haptek, but because of the way they talk about animating the character it might be another system.
        
 - They don't present their model of feedback in details. So we don't know how their system decides what to express based on the inputs (mouse, keyboard, user emotions, character emotions, user position).

They define empathy as the ability to detect what others feel and to experience that emotion ourselves (seems like mimicry).
        
Empirical evidence indicates that expressing accurate empathy can lead to positive psychological, physical and health outcomes.
        
Their results show: 
1. The positive attitude of the users toward active support (active empathy). 
2.{\^A}  The positive outcome of an empathic system regardless of its representation. 
3.{\^A}  A system represented by a human-like representation is expected to be empathic.
        
they believe, adding a mechanism to allow the users to freely express themselves does not improve the effectiveness or liking of an empathic system.

A decision making agent relates these signals and the user{\^a}€{\texttrademark}s answer to arousal and valence to infer the user{\^a}€{\texttrademark}s emotional state by applying the model of Lang (1995) (Lang claims that all emotions can be characterized in terms of valence (pleasant or unpleasant) and arousal (calm or aroused)). Then it selects empathetic actions that maximize some utility function. They use text-based empathetic actions in addition to a small full body character.We can use the decision-theoretic agent aspect in our empathy model.
The empathy is mainly expressed in a text-base fashion in their job. The embodied agent that they have is so small and no facial expressions are used. There are some gestural expressions.
As shown in this paper and many other ones, text-base empathy expression can be effective. So we can use that too.
